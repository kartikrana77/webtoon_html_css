          In the world of magic, there exist deadly irreversible techniques
          commonly known as spellblades. These sparse and elusive spells, along
          with their casters, are shrouded in mystery and only their absolute
          lethality is known to the masses. Every year, the spring blossom
          signifies a new intake of students to the prestigious magic school
          Kimberly. With reactions of awe and bewilderment, a ceremonious parade
          complete with magical beasts welcomes the newcomers to the
          institution. Among them is the mysterious Oliver Horn, whose
          indifference changes to fascination as he notices a peculiar figure—a
          girl wearing strange attire equipped with a Japanese sword. From the
          entrance ceremony onward, Oliver realizes that not all is as it seems
          at Kimberly, as the emergence of labyrinths, monsters, and other
          threats endanger the new student body. Nanatsu no Maken ga Shihai suru
          explores the intertwined fates of two warriors as they uncover the
          dark truths that lurk within the walls of the academy.
