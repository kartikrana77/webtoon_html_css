            A promising pâtissier meets his demise and leaves the world without
            ever having achieved his dream of making the world's greatest
            pastry. But when he is given another chance, he reincarnates as
            nine-year-old Pastry Mille Morteln, determined to be successful this
            second time. His life would not be as sweet as his treats, though,
            as he encounters unfamiliar hardships in the magical world. To get
            one step closer to his lifelong desire, Pastry must learn how to
            fight, utilizing his confectionary knowledge and discovering magic
            along the way.

              Springtime at Kimberly Magic Academy brings a new batch of
              first-year students. Among this year's batch is a one Oliver Horn,
              a boy with a mission burning in his chest. His objective is to
              exact vengeance on the members of Kimberly's faculty that brutally
              murdered his mother, however, when he meets a samurai girl from
              the distant nation of Yamatsu, Oliver is trapped between his
              mission and his curiosity with the samurai girl, Nanao Hibiya.
              Alongside her, Oliver meets several other students that he becomes
              fast friends with, however, will these friendships prove
              detrimental to Oliver's vendetta? More importantly, as introduced
              to him and the rest of the first-years during the entrance
              ceremony, Kimberly Academy has never once seen a school year
              without a single student death. Can Oliver and his friends survive
              these seven years of hell?
