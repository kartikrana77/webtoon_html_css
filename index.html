      <big>  A promising pâtissier meets his demise and leaves the world without ever
        having achieved his dream of making the world's greatest pastry. But
        when he is given another chance, he reincarnates as nine-year-old Pastry
        Mille Morteln, determined to be successful this second time. His life
        would not be as sweet as his treats, though, as he encounters unfamiliar
        hardships in the magical world. To get one step closer to his lifelong
        desire, Pastry must learn how to fight, utilizing his confectionary
        knowledge and discovering magic along the way.
