          A promising pâtissier meets his demise and leaves the world without
          ever having achieved his dream of making the world's greatest pastry.
          But when he is given another chance, he reincarnates as nine-year-old
          Pastry Mille Morteln, determined to be successful this second time.
          His life would not be as sweet as his treats, though, as he encounters
          unfamiliar hardships in the magical world. To get one step closer to
          his lifelong desire, Pastry must learn how to fight, utilizing his
          confectionary knowledge and discovering magic along the way.

          A boy named Pastry is set to become the next lord of the destitute
          dominion of Morteln. He's known for having remarkable talent for his
          age... and it just so happens he was a genius pastry chef with a
          promising future in his previous life! He still retains his
          determination to make sweets that will make everyone smile, even after
          reincarnating as Pastry. But many challenges stand before him,
          including bandits attacking his domain, malicious and eccentric
          nobles, an unfortunate financial situation, and land so barren that
          even water is scarce. The only weapons he has to fight them with are
          his own ingenuity and love for</big
