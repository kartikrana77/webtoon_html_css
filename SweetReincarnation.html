        A promising pâtissier meets his demise and leaves the world without ever
        having achieved his dream of making the world's greatest pastry. But
        when he is given another chance, he reincarnates as nine-year-old Pastry
        Mille Morteln, determined to be successful this second time. His life
        would not be as sweet as his treats, though, as he encounters unfamiliar
        hardships in the magical world. To get one step closer to his lifelong
        desire, Pastry must learn how to fight, utilizing his confectionary
        knowledge and discovering magic along the way.

        A boy named Pastry is set to become the next lord of the destitute
        dominion of Morteln. He's known for having remarkable talent for his
        age... and it just so happens he was a genius pastry chef with a
        promising future in his previous life! He still retains his
        determination to make sweets that will make everyone smile, even after
        reincarnating as Pastry. But many challenges stand before him, including
        bandits attacking his domain, malicious and eccentric nobles, an
        unfortunate financial situation, and land so barren that even water is
        scarce. The only weapons he has to fight them with are his own ingenuity
        and love for</big
